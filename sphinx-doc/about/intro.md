# Goals
 
## ML Auto Vision  A user-friendly end-to-end ML-System

Main Costs of AI Projects

1. Repetitive Data Handling
1. **A lot** of trial and error

## Goal


Be user-friendly

- Modern, efficient UI
- stop writing code for easy, repetitive tasks 

Avoid duplicate code across ML projects

- Extensible 
- Reusable 

Automatically explore standard models for user-specified datasets

- Model architecture search
- Hyper-Parameter search

Backwards compatibility to existing projects

- Seamless integration
- File-based plugins



## Similar applications

Typcially commercial cloud services, limited label formats supported or limited
features.

### Supervisely

Supervisely tries to help labeling large datasets and integrate model training 
and evaluation. 

Main drawbacks are: 

- The service is cloud based
- Closed source commercial.
- Limited support for data formats

### Google Auto ML

Google Auto ML tries to help managing large datasets and integrate model training 
and evaluation. Also does hyper-parameter and model search.
 
Main drawbacks are: 

- The service is cloud based
- Closed source and commercial.
- Limited support for arbitrary data formats. Datasets are required to be in a specific format.

### LOST

Offline solution, helps with labeling, does not go the extra mile for model search.
Only labeling tool, but free of charge open source. 

- Limited support of label formats
- No model search / AutoML

### AWS AutoML

Automatically does preprocessing, finds a good model for the data. 

- Cloud based service
- Closed source and commercial
- Limited support for arbitrary data formats. Datasets are required to be in a specific format.
