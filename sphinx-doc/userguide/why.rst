Why MAVIS?
----------

Do you or your team members have plenty of these lying around?

- Notebooks
- Code snippets
- Scripts
- Utils
- Gists

Have you ever dreamt of building them
into a real software?
A real software that

- allows you to run your code via button click
- has a UI for your python parameters,
- remembers and logs your actions,
- persists your settings for the next run or user,
- allows you to edit all the code in one place with an actual IDE
- does data handling via UI
- lets you chain multiple of your scripts into sharable workflows
