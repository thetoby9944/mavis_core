Why MAVIS?
----------

Do you have plenty of these lying around?

- Notebooks
- Code snippets
- Scripts
- Utils
- Gists

Have you ever dreamt of building them
into a real software?
A real software that

- allows you to **run your code via button click**
- **has a UI** for your python parameters,
- **remembers** and logs your **actions**,
- **persists your settings** for the next run or user,
- allows you to edit all the code in one place **use it with an actual IDE**
- **does data handling** via both UI and code
- lets you chain multiple of your scripts into **sharable workflows**
